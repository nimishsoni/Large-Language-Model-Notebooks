Repo hosting Large Language Model experimentation notebooks
## https://github.com/nimishsoni/Large-Language-Model-Notebooks/blob/main/Chatbot_Prompt_Engineering_SQLTraslator_OpenAI_API.ipynb
  The notebook has code to create a Chatbot: that interacts with user to get order details for a restaurant, a SQL Translator that converts natural language queries to SQL, and Prompt Engineering using OpenAI API.

## https://github.com/nimishsoni/Large-Language-Model-Notebooks/blob/main/LangChain_Agent_create_Data_Scientist_Assistant.ipynb
  Notebook to create a data scientist assistant using LangChain. Given a complex data science task the assistant solves it in logical steps through exploration, pre-processing, and modeling. 

## https://github.com/nimishsoni/Large-Language-Model-Notebooks/blob/main/Moderation_system_with_LLAMA_2_LangChain_and_HF.ipynb
  In this notebook, we create an automated customer service assistant that replies to customer complaints in an automated way. The following are the implementation steps:
  Use TinyLama model and tokenizer pretrained and available on HF
- Use HuggingFace Pipeline to create an assistant model
- Create and provide the prompt template for the assistant model which gives template for expected response and create chain using Langchain
